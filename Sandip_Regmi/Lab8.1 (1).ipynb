    "I realized I wrote our syllabus and schedule of material like we weren't going to be one year into a global pandemic. So I am adjusting and making a more realistic schedule (more on Wed), which means scaling back the amount of material we will cover, and for now doing one chapter in datacamp a class instead of two or more. If by some miracle you have the mental bandwith, feel free to do extra work, but I in no way expect or encourage this. The main goal of this class is to empower you all to know how to figure out how to learn what you need, and we will still very much reach this goal. Every scientific progammer I know is self taught, and is learning just like you all, by looking at sample code, googling, and using online resources. You all are doing great! Let's have realistic expectations of ourselves for the next few months.\n",

    "1. Personal health (physical, mental, emotional). You have to take care of your health so you can help others.\n",
    "1. Health of loved ones (physical, mental, emotional).\n",
    "1. Research (if you are a grad student particularly)\n",
    "1. Classwork (you might need to put this above research if you need perfect grades for fellowships, etc.)\n"
