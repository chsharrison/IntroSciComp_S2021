	volume = {66},
	url = {http://archives.datapages.com/data/gcags/data/066/066001/169_gcags660169.htm},
	abstract = {The delta of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo in southernmost Texas and northern Tamaulipas is one of the major deltas of North America. Over 600,000 people live on the Holocene delta and river plain, and a million more on its Pleistocene ancestors, yet geologic knowledge is limited. Combining available geologic information with global satellite photography gives a balanced view of an important delta.
The Holocene delta begins at a point west of San Benito, Texas, forming a classic eastward-opening delta. Over half of the delta lies south of the present Rio Grande drainage. The delta passes westward into a floodplain that becomes entrenched into older rocks westward to Roma. In this delta, distributary channels or resacas are extremely sinuous and show a pronounced levee rise. A yazoo stream in the floodplain cuts northward across Pleistocene deposits to form a displaced delta. The delta plain is extensively modified by eolian processes. Erosion of clay-rich algal mats from exposed esteros (large, shallow ephemeral lakes) create complex ‘clay dune‘ deposits that form 6 m (20 ft) high hills (lomitas) on the flat plain. Dominant {SE} to {SSE} winds affect sand movement along the transgressive shorelines. Longshore movement is particularly effective on the north side of the delta, less so on the south side.
The delta appears to have formed between 8000 and 3000 years {BP} by a robust, sediment-loaded Rio Grande. This period occurs during the Holocene Climatic Optimum, which was a dry time (altithermal) on the High Plains. Since 3000 years {BP}, the delta has been much less active and has been transgressed by barrier systems. The delta today is inactive, because of upstream reservoirs built since the 1940s. Before then, the river had irregular high discharge due to tropical systems and contributions from the upper Rio Grande system. The Pleistocene deltas that form the Beaumont surface underlying {McAllen}, Edinburg, and Harlingen probably exhibit similar landforms.},

	title = {Bi-national Water Issues in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Basin},
	volume = {4},
	abstract = {The Rio Grande (called the Rı́o Bravo in Mexico) is the fifth largest river on the North American continent. The river supports extensive irrigated agriculture as well as rapidly growing cities in three {US} and five Mexican states. From El Paso, Texas to the Gulf of Mexico, the river marks the international border between Mexico and the United States. Treaties for sharing the water of the Rio Grande between the two countries and arrangements for joint management were concluded in 1906 and 1944. Over time, a complex system of water management institutions has emerged. Water problems are pronounced, due to intensive development in an arid environment. Over the course of the last 40 years, the population in the border communities has doubled every 20 years. Demographic projections predict another doubling of the population by 2030.

The entire Rio Grande basin is arid or semi-arid. Development has already led to a severe loss of biodiversity in parts of the basin. Development of new surface water resources is not a realistic option. The principal water management options are as follows: improved efficiency of water use, transfer of agricultural to urban uses of water, conservation and re-use of water, and treatment of brackish groundwater. Up to now, differences in law and levels of development between Mexico and the United States have made it difficult to develop basin-wide management strategies. In addition, regional differences in hydrological conditions argue in favor of developing separate but linked strategies for the sub-basins. This paper presents the key issues in two sub-basins with the largest population centers on the international border—the Paso del Norte (Las Cruces, New Mexico, El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua), and the Rio Grande Valley (Reynosa–Matamoros on the Mexican side, and {MacAllen}–Brownsville on the {US} side). Together, these cities will have 8 million inhabitants by 2030. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving management of river and groundwater in this bi-national growth region.},

	abstract = {Radiocarbon-dated deltaic sequences of Holocene age from different parts of the world began to accumulate within a restricted time range, from about 8500 to 6500 years ago. Evaluation of major delta processes indicates that deceleration in sea-level rise was the key factor in Holocene delta formation. Within many deltas, there is as much as a 2000-year age range between basal deposits in seaward and landward cores. This age difference records the progressive landward migration of near mean sea-level depositional environments during the lower to mid-Holocene. Establishment of a chronostratigraphic framework for Holocene delta development provides a fundamental global baseline for distinguishing sea-level change from vertical land motion by tectonism and isostasy, and for evaluating rates of future marine incursion into low-lying deltas.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.04.029},
	abstract = {With changing climate and rising seas, proliferation of hydroelectric dams, instream sand mining, dyking of floodplains, accelerated subsidence from groundwater pumping, accelerated sea-level rise, and other anthropic impacts, it is certain that the Mekong Delta will undergo large changes in the coming decades. These changes will threaten the very existence of the landform itself. The multiplicity of compounding drivers and lack of reliable data lead to large uncertainties in forecasting changes in the sediment budget of the Mekong Delta, its morphology, and the ecosystems and human livelihoods it supports. We compile information on key drivers affecting the sediment budget of the Mekong Delta and compare them to quantify the magnitude of effects from different drivers. We develop a set of likely scenarios for the future development of these drivers and quantify implications for the future of the Mekong Delta using a simplified model of the delta's geometry. If sediment supply to the delta is nearly completely cut off, as would be the case with full buildout of planned dams and current rates of sediment mining, and with continued groundwater pumping at current rates, our model forecasts that the delta will almost completely disappear by the end of this century due to increased rates of delta subsidence and rising sea levels. While local management cannot prevent global sea level rise, model results suggest that there are important management steps that could prolong the persistence of the delta ecosystem and the livelihoods it supports, including a reduction in ground water pumping and maintaining sediment connectivity between the basin and the delta.},
